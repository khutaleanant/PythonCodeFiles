# #What is Polymorphism: The word polymorphism means having many
# forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function name
# (but different signatures) being used for different types. The key
# difference is the data types and number of arguments used in
# function.Python program to demonstrate in-built poly-
# # morphic functions
# len() being used for a string

a=len("Anant")
print(a)

a=len([10,20,30,"anant"])
print(a)

b=max((10,20,30,40))
